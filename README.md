# üëã Hi there
I am an Internet Systems student, Data Analysis and Data Science enthusiast, I spend a lot of my time studying to adequately prepare myself to enter the job market,</br> wish me luck :).
# üöÄ Expertise

As a student I could not have very relevant or extraordinary experiences that are worth describing here, my brief experience was with college projects such as developing a fictitious company, creating its website, infographics, presentation videos, agendas and discussions to be presented. , a brief article about the internet in Brazil using references and demonstrating its points and I produced a short podcast presented in class.

I hope to be able to acquire more and more experiences and with them I can improve my skills.
